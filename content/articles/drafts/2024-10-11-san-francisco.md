Defining Our Objectives
The idea is to create articles quickly using Markdown, a user-friendly and familiar format. These Markdown files will collectively form the article list within the blog section.

A functional blog section should have an index page listing all available articles, each with its title, description, images, and additional information. Clicking on an article should smoothly transition the user to the dedicated article page, styled with our custom CSS. For a modern touch, we might even consider adding share buttons at the end.
